**Upgrade to laravel 5.2**

Follow the [Laravel upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/upgrade#upgrade-5.2.0) to upgrade your application and modules.

**Re-publish configuration files**

Configuration files across modules has been changed, mostly the `permissions.php` files.

Using the following command you will be able to publish a module config files.

``` .language-bash
php artisan module:publish-config --force
```

If you edited the module configurations, you will need to manually copy over the new files, depending on what you changed, you can also publish each module individually.
