Menus in AsgardCMS are used like in any other site, to have a series of links available somewhere on your front-end layout. You can have as many menus as you want, a top-menu, a main menu, footer menu and so on. 
Each menu can have multiple **menuitems**. A menuitem can be linked to a specific URI, URL or a page.

If you select Page, that page will be displayed when hitting the requested URI. You can also define per menu item if the link needs to be opened in the same page (*target = _self*) or a new one (*target = _blank*).
