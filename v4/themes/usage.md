In this section we will go over on how to create and manage themes. You can view a demo frontend, [Flatly](https://github.com/AsgardCms/Flatly-theme) theme and [demo backend theme](https://github.com/AsgardCms/AdminLTE) for your inspiration.

## <a name="folder-structure" class="anchor" href="#folder-structure">Folder structure</a>

A theme has to have a `theme.json` file which will contain the theme name, its description and type (frontend | backend). All your views will be located in the `views` directory. Those views will use assets that are located in the `assets` folder. This asset folder will be published in the public directory. I'd recommend placing your `less`, `sass`, `coffeescript` files inside a `resources` folder which thanks to gulp will be published to the `assets` folder. 

You can create a theme by creating a folder inside the `Themes` folder.

This would be a typical type structure:

``` .language-markup
.
Themes/
├── Demo
│   ├── assets
│   |	└── js
│   |	├── css
│   |	├── fonts
│   |	├── img
│   ├── resources
│   |	└── less
│   |	├── coffee
│   ├── views
│   ├── bower.json
│   ├── composer.json
│   ├── gulpfile
│   ├── theme.json
│   ├── package.json
```

A `theme.json` file looks like this: 

``` .language-javascript
{
  "name": "AdminLTE",
  "description": "This is an administration theme",
  "type": "backend"
}
```
The `theme.json` file has to have a `type` key. This has to be either **backend** or **frontend**. 

The primary difference between both, beyond the obvious reason, is that the **backend** theme *won't* show up in the settings module in the theme dropdown.

To set a backend theme, you need to edit the `config/asgard.core.core.php` config file and set the `admin-theme` option. The has to correspond with the `name` key in `module.json`.


## <a name="commands" class="anchor" href="#commands">Commands</a>

As you can see the assets live in the `Themes` folder in the root directory. To publish the assets to the public directory and make the accessible to the webserver, you have to use a publish command:

``` .language-bash
php artisan asgard:publish:theme
```


## <a name="linking-to-theme-assets" class="anchor" href="#linking-to-theme-assets">Linking to theme assets</a>

To link to a theme asset you can use the following helpers:

``` .language-markup
{!! Theme::style('css/vendor/bootstrap.min.css') !!}

{!! Theme::script('js/vendor/jquery.min.js') !!}
```
These will directly output the `<style>` and `<script>` tags.

If you want to directly get a URL of a resource you can use the following helper:

``` .language-markup
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ Theme::url('favicon.ico') }}">
```

## <a name="display-a-theme-page" class="anchor" href="#display-a-theme-page">Display a theme page</a>

To display a page from a theme, or using its layout, there is nothing new; use the `View::make` as normal.

For instance if you have set the active theme to `Demo`, when you use `View::make('index')`, it'll check for the page inside your Demo theme folder `Themes/demo/index.blade.php`.


## <a name="elixir" class="anchor" href="#elixir">Elixir publish helper</a>

Since all assets need to be published to the `public/` folder you can use the following custom **mix** for [Laravel Elixir](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/elixir).

Place this at the top of your `Gulpfile`:


``` .language-javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var shell = require('gulp-shell');
var elixir = require('laravel-elixir');
var themeInfo = require('./theme.json');

var Task = elixir.Task;

elixir.extend('stylistPublish', function() {
    new Task('stylistPublish', function() {
        return gulp.src("").pipe(shell("php ../../artisan stylist:publish " + themeInfo.name));
    });
});
```

With this defined, in your `Gulpfile` you can now do the following:

``` .language-javascript
mix
    .less([
       "main.less"
    ])
   .stylistPublish();
```

Elixir will now compile `main.less`, and publish the compiled css to the `public/` folder.
